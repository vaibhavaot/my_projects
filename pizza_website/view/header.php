 <!-- Note from eoneil: 
    Note that it isn't good programming practice to have such specific 
    strings as 'cs637/eoneil' embedded in code, but PHP doesn't make
    it easy to do better. We will tackle this problem in the next project.
    The "app_path" is location of the project relative to the
    web server's document root.
